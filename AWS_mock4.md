Amazon FSx for Windows File Server can integrate with Microsoft active directory

â€¢ An instance can NOT be hibernated more than 60 days

MPI PROTOCOL : parallel processes (AWS BATCH)

With AWS Batch multi-node parallel jobs, you can run large-scale, tightly coupled, high performance computing applications and distributed GPU model training without the need to launch, configure, and manage Amazon EC2 resources directly.

Amazon ElastiCache for Redis cluster: REDIS AUTH command to secure a pswd to access db

Amazon DynamoDB Streams captures a time-ordered sequence of **item-level modifications** in any DynamoDB table and stores this information in a log for up to 24 hours. 

until some period of time if modify/del cheyakudadhu anukunte : Create an S3 bucket with S3 Object Lock enabled. Enable versioning. Add a legal hold to the objects. Add the s3:PutObjectLegalHold permission to the IAM policies of users who need to delete the objects.

Configure a lifecycle policy to move the files to the EFS Infrequent Access (IA) storage class after 7 days.

Use AWS License Manager to manage the software licenses

AWS Private 5G is a managed service that makes it easy to deploy, operate, and scale your own private cellular network, with all required hardware and software provided by AWS.

AWS CloudHSM is a cloud-based hardware security module (HSM) that enables you to easily generate and use your own encryption keys on the AWS Cloud

AWS Outposts is a family of fully managed solutions delivering AWS infrastructure and services to virtually any on-premises or edge location for a truly consistent hybrid experience

AWS Wavelength embeds AWS compute and storage services within 5G networks, providing mobile edge computing infrastructure for developing, deploying, and scaling ultra-low-latency applications.

Enable detailed monitoring on all EC2 instances. Use Amazon CloudWatch metrics to perform the analysis.

A company plans to provide developers with individual AWS accounts. The company will use AWS Organizations to provision the accounts. A Solutions Architect must implement secure auditing using AWS CloudTrail so that all events from all AWS accounts are logged. The developers must not be able to use root-level permissions to alter the AWS CloudTrail configuration in any way or access the log files in the S3 bucket. The auditing solution and security controls must automatically apply to all new developer accounts that are created: 
Create a new trail in CloudTrail from within the management account with the organization trails option enabled.(DON'T USE SCP FOR THIS)

200tb of data transfer through multiple snowball devices (don't use snowmobile coz it is truch kind of and useful for very huge data)

Create an Amazon S3 interface VPC endpoint in the subnet where the EC2 instance is located. Add a resource policy to the S3 bucket to allow only the EC2 instance's IAM role access.

 structured data and unstructured data analysis: redshift by spectrum

 Amazon Aurora does not have an option to run a Microsoft SQL Server database

 KDF cannot load data to Snowball devices and Lambda@Edge is used with CloudFront for processing data.

 default encryttion: Create a bucket policy that denies Put requests that do not have an x-amz-server-side-encryption header set.

 aws:Secure Transport header set to true". This header is used for SSL/TLS.

 MongoDB database running on-premises must be migrated to Amazon DynamoDB: Use the Schema Conversion Tool (SCT) to extract and load the data to an AWS Snowball Edge device. Use the AWS Database Migration Service (DMS) to migrate the data to Amazon DynamoDB

 A Solutions Architect has placed an Amazon CloudFront distribution in front of their web server, which is serving up a highly accessed website, serving content globally. The Solutions Architect needs to dynamically route the user to a new URL depending on where the user is accessing from, through running a particular script. This dynamic routing will happen on every request, and as a result requires the code to run at extremely low latency, and low cost.: At the Edge Location, run your code with CloudFront Functions.

 RAID 0 excels in speed through striping but is at the risk of data loss in the event of a single drive failure. RAID 0 offers the best performance and capacity but no fault tolerance. RAID 0 is best for storage that is noncritical but requires high-speed reads and writes.

 RAID 1 prioritizes data redundancy through mirroring, ensuring data integrity even if a drive fails, but with reduced usable disk capacity.Raid 1 created multiple copies of ur data

 When fault tolerance is more important than I/O performance a RAID 1 array should be used which creates a mirror of your data for extra redundancy.

 Migrate from Oracle to Oracle on Amazon RDS using the AWS Database Migration Service (AWS DMS).

 2 different accounts vpc sharing

 Use Amazon SageMaker to build the machine learning part of the application and use AWS Data Exchange to gain access to the third-party telemetry data.

 GraphQL API: appsync

 AWS AppSync is a serverless GraphQL and Pub/Sub API service that simplifies building modern web and mobile applications.

 Deploy a Landing Zone within AWS Control Tower. Allow department administrators to use the Landing Zone to create new member accounts and networking. Grant the department's AWS power user permissions on the created accounts.

Create an AWS Config rule to check for the key age. Define an Amazon EventBridge rule to execute an AWS Lambda function that removes the key.
